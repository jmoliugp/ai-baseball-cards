# Cursor Rules: AI Baseball Cards Project

## Project Intelligence

### Project Type
Full-stack TypeScript monorepo application with AI integration for a technical interview exercise.

### Key Characteristics
- **Timeline**: Target 1-2 hours for core functionality, extended time for polish
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate technical skills and AI-assisted development
- **Scope**: Baseball player statistics viewer with AI-generated descriptions

### Tech Stack Preferences
- **Language**: TypeScript everywhere (frontend, backend, AI agent)
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces
- **Code Quality**: Biome for linting and formatting across all packages
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query
- **Backend**: Fastify, Zod, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **AI**: LangGraph for orchestration

## Development Workflow

### Approach
1. **Mock-First**: Build with mock data before real integration
2. **Iterative**: Implement in phases, test each stage
3. **Documentation**: Keep Memory Bank updated
4. **Step-by-step**: Don't rush, ensure each piece works before moving on

### Critical Paths
- Database is required from the start (for edits and AI descriptions)
- AI agent is separate package but integrates with backend
- Frontend uses TanStack Query for all server state

### Code Organization
```
ai-baseball-cards/
├── packages/
│   ├── frontend/    # React app
│   ├── backend/     # Fastify API
│   └── ai-agent/    # LangGraph AI
├── memory-bank/     # Project documentation
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

## Patterns & Preferences

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types
- Zod for runtime validation
- Shared types between packages

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Consistent error responses
- Zod validation on all inputs
- Proper HTTP status codes

### Frontend
- Component composition over inheritance
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- TanStack Query for all API calls
- Shadcn UI components, not custom CSS

### Database
- Prisma for all database access
- Repository pattern via services
- Migrations version controlled
- Seed script for initial data

### Docker
- Development: Local scripts with hot-reload
- Production: Multi-stage builds
- PostgreSQL always in container
- Docker Compose for orchestration

## AI Integration Notes

### Description Generation
- Async processing (don't block UI)
- Cache generated descriptions in DB
- Retry logic for API failures
- Clear prompt versioning

### Development with AI
- Document AI usage for interview presentation
- Show how AI accelerated development
- Explain AI-assisted decisions

## Common Gotchas
- Remember to run `pnpm install` after adding packages
- Biome config must be in each package or root
- TanStack Query needs query client provider
- Shadcn components need to be added manually

## Testing Philosophy
- Unit tests for validation and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Manual QA for demo features
- Keep it simple given time constraints

## Demo Considerations
- All features must work reliably
- Clean, readable code for walkthrough
- Be ready to explain architectural decisions
- Show AI usage examples

## Lessons Learned
